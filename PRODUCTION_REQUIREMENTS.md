# üö® PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

## ‚ùå CURRENT STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY

The transaction system requires several components to be production-ready:

## üîß REQUIRED BACKEND API

You **MUST** implement a backend server with these endpoints:

### 1. Payment Intent Creation
```
POST /api/payments/create-intent
```
- Creates Stripe PaymentIntent with your **secret key**
- Validates user authentication
- Stores transaction in database

### 2. Payment Confirmation  
```
POST /api/payments/confirm
```
- Confirms payment with Stripe
- Updates transaction status

### 3. Handoff Verification
```
POST /api/payments/verify-handoff
```
- Verifies handoff code
- Releases payment to seller (captures PaymentIntent)

### 4. Transaction Status
```
GET /api/payments/transaction/:id
```
- Gets current transaction status

## üîë REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### Frontend (.env)
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Backend (.env)
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_KEY=path_to_service_account.json
```

## üóÑÔ∏è REQUIRED DATABASE SCHEMA

### Transactions Collection
```javascript
{
  payment_intent_id: string,
  amount: number,
  product_id: string,
  seller_id: string,
  buyer_id: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  is_digital: boolean,
  handoff_code: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  confirmed_at: timestamp,
  handoff_verified_at: timestamp
}
```

## üîí SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

1. **Authentication**: All API calls must verify JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Users can only access their own transactions
3. **Validation**: Validate all input data
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent payment spam
5. **HTTPS**: All production traffic must use SSL

## üìã DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Backend API server deployed
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoints configured
- [ ] Firebase Admin SDK configured
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Database indexes created
- [ ] SSL certificates installed
- [ ] Error monitoring setup (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Payment reconciliation system

## üö´ WHAT'S MISSING NOW

1. **No backend server** - Frontend can't create real PaymentIntents
2. **No authentication validation** - Anyone could make payments
3. **No database persistence** - Transactions aren't stored
4. **No webhook handling** - Can't handle Stripe events
5. **No error handling** - Production errors not handled
6. **No monitoring** - No payment tracking/analytics

## üìñ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

1. **Use the provided `backend-api-example.js`** as your starting point
2. **Deploy backend** using Node.js/Express or your preferred stack
3. **Configure Stripe webhooks** for payment events
4. **Set up monitoring** for payment failures
5. **Test thoroughly** with Stripe test cards
6. **Deploy with proper security** (HTTPS, rate limiting, etc.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATE

The current implementation is a **demo/prototype** that:
- Shows the UI/UX flow
- Demonstrates the handoff code concept
- Provides the frontend architecture

But it **CANNOT process real payments** without the backend infrastructure.

## üí° QUICK START FOR TESTING

For immediate testing without backend:
1. The UI will show "Stripe not configured" errors
2. Payment buttons won't work
3. Handoff codes won't verify

To make it work, you need the full backend implementation.
